Keeping the cousins in both hemispheres connected

## Summary

The result of me trying to have my kids and their cousins play minecraft
together. Pretty early on I determined that Minecraft PE and Minecraft
clients are not compatible. This led me down the deep dark rathole of
standing up a simple minecraft server.

In this case, we are running two...Cuberite and Pocketmine-MP.

## How to run

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/quickstart/)

2. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

3. Run the following command...

```
docker-compose up -d
```

World */data* should be saved in the respective folders for each server.
